## Hi there 👋

This is a collection of repositories used for the Colorado State University Graduate [Cell and Molecular Biology program's](https://cmb.colostate.edu/) quantitative resources.

Our mission is to introduce students to basic computational biology topics and skills, and support their progression to advanced techniques in research.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
