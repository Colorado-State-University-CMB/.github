Our mission is to introduce students to basic computational biology topics and skills, and support their progression to advanced techniques in research.

There are course repositories for Introduction to CM515: Quantitative Cell and Molecular Biology (formerly CM580A3). There are also forks of software and datacarpentry lessons that have been adapted for Colorado State platforms and resources.
